### What I learned

In this project, the first concept that was new to me was asynchronous data fetching. I learned how to make HTTP requests and fetch data from a JSON file using axios. I utilized this technique within the useEffect hook to retrieve the data and then extracted the relevant information from it. additionally, I used the useState hook to manage the component state and pass data to child components.
